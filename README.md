# Peer-2-Peer-Chat-Application
This project implements a fully decentralized peer-to-peer chat system based on a logical ring. Peers discover each other via UDP broadcast, detect crashes using heartbeats, and repair the ring autonomously. A leader elected with the LeLann–Chang–Roberts algorithm provides total order message delivery.
